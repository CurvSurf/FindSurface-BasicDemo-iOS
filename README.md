## [FindSurface Library Package]()

Unlike the older version of this demo, you don't need to download or setup the binary path for your project since the library is provided as a Swift package.


## About the point cloud

The point cloud in this demo is the same as the sample used in FindSurface WebDemo. Please refer to the [WebDemo](https://developers.curvsurf.com/WebDemo/) for a visual representation of FindSurface's results.
